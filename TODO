-Power +24V to the egde of the connector so it is switchable with p-FETs
-Logic +24V on two pins of the connector so that the CPUs can boot without Power +24V
-Shared GND
-Chained SPI (CLK/MISO is parallel to all slaves, MOSI is broken at each connector)
	-Every slave uses two transmitters on MISO/SOSI
	-MISO transmitter needs TX enable on GPIO
	-SN65C1168E or similar
	-Two broken pin on slave with two GPIOs (end detection)
-Parallel half-duplex UART, RS485 (half duplex RS485 driver eg SP3485)

-Optional 2nd fast SPI (SN65C1168E/SN75C1168/SN7534051)
	-if not used pins need to be bridged on card (quesion: needs passthrough plug on empty cards then)
	-doesn't work with just 32 pins

-LMI is terminated on master
-LSC might need terminating on each backplane board (1k?/lowpass)
